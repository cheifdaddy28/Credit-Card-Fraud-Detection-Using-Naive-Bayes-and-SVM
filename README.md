MSc Data Science Thesis 


# Motivation
Credit Card Fraud as indicated in the background is a very major issue which has significant consequence on global economy. Credit card affects several stakeholders in the economy. The public who patronise the card, the finance institution, regulators and the government. Therefore, the issue of great priority to all these stakeholder groups.

Stakeholders are concerned about the issue and are in support of measures that need to be instigated in other to insulate the sector against such attacks. 

# Project Objectives
1.	To predict whether a credit card is being used by the cardholder or a fraudster using machine learning algorithms
2.	To distinguish between authentic and fraudulent credit card transaction
3.	To create a fraud detector application

# Research Questions
1.	How will machine learning algorithm be used in detecting detect credit card fraud?
2.	How to identify and distinguish between fraudulent and credit authentic credit card transaction?
